  This is the final project of a Full Stack Bootcamp course that I am taking. It is essentially a Yelp clone which consists of campgrounds instead of restaurants.
It is also the starting point of my web development journey, as simple as it may be it has taught me a great deal about coding and what a full stack project consists of.
I loved creating it and can't wait to make some more!
